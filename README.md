# **Flutter Examples**

This repository only aims to list examples of packages/custom widgets and applications developed with **[Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter)** for the purpose of curiosity and study. For more info about it, check it's website or repository, since it's open source and a great tool for developing beautiful applications for mobile, web and desktop.

**PS: Some projects are fully functional, some only has the UI built.**

This following project is a great source to study about project structure, use of MobX, consume API, routing and more. This one deserves a special and slower look. Here it is:
